        Cognitive modeling is one way to evaluate the usability of a product.
        This method uses experimental times to calculate cognitive and motor
        processing time. The value of the human processor model is that it
        allows a system designer to predict the performance with respect to time
        it takes a person to complete a task without performing experiments.
        Other modeling methods include inspection methods, inquiry methods,
        prototyping methods, and testing methods.

        The standard definition for MHP is: The MHP draws an analogy between the
        processing and storage areas of a computer, with the perceptual, motor,
        cognitive and memory areas of the computer user.

      <p class="text-warning">
        The human processor model uses the cognitive, perceptual, and motor
        processors along with the visual image, working memory, and long term
        memory storages. A diagram is shown below. Each processor has a cycle
        time and each memory has a decay time. These values are also included
        below. By following the connections diagrammed below, along with the
        associated cycle or decay times, the time it takes a user to perform a
        certain task can be calculated. Studies into this field were initially
        done by Stuart K. Card, Thomas P. Moran, & Allen Newell in 1983.[1]
        Current studies in the field include work to distinguish process times
        in older adults by Tiffany Jastrembski and Neil Charness (2007).

      The calculations depend on the ability to break down every step of a task
      into the basic process level. The more detailed the analysis, the more
      accurate the model will be to predict human performance. The method for
      determining processes can be broken down into the following steps.

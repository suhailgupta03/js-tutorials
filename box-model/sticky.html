        In 2005, at the age of 19,[13] Altman co-founded Loopt,[14] a
        location-based social networking mobile application. As CEO, Altman
        raised more than $30 million in venture capital for the company;
        however, Loopt failed to gain traction with enough users. In March 2012,
        it was acquired by the Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million.[15] The
        following month, Altman co-founded Hydrazine Capital with his brother,
        Jack Altman.[16][17] Altman became a partner at Y Combinator, a startup
        accelerator that invests in a wide range of startups, in 2011, initially
        working there on a part-time basis.[18] In February 2014, Altman was
        named president of Y Combinator by its co-founder, Paul Graham.[19] In a
        2014 blog post, Altman said that the total valuation of Y Combinator
        companies had surpassed $65 billion, including Airbnb, Dropbox,
        Zenefits, and Stripe.[20] In September 2016, Altman announced his
        expanded role as president of YC Group, which included Y Combinator and
        other units.[21] Altman said that he hoped to expand Y Combinator to
        fund 1,000 new companies per year. He also tried to expand the types of
        companies funded by YC, especially "hard technology" companies.[22] In
        October 2015, Altman announced YC Continuity, a $700 million equity fund
        investing in YC companies as they matured.[23] A week earlier, Altman
        had introduced Y Combinator Research, a non-profit research lab, and
        donated $10 million to fund it.[24] YC Research has thus far announced
        research on basic income, the future of computing, education, and
        building new cities.[25] In March 2019, YC announced Altman's transition
        from the president of the company to a less hands-on role as chairman of
        the board, for him to focus on OpenAI.[26][27] This decision came
        shortly after YC announced it would be moving its headquarters to San
        Francisco.[28][29] As of early 2020, he was no longer affiliated with
        YC.[5] It was later reported that Altman was fired from YC, and had
        appointed himself Chairman without authorization.[30] Altman co-founded
        Tools For Humanity in 2019,[31] a company which builds and distributes
        systems designed to scan people's eyes to provide authentication and
        verify proof of personhood to counter fraud. People who agree to have
        their eyes scanned are compensated with a cryptocurrency called
        Worldcoin.[32][33][34][35] Tools For Humanity describes its
        cryptocurrency as similar to universal basic income.[36][37] Altman has
        several other investments. Including, "Humane", the world's first
        wearable computer powered by AI, "Retro Biosciences", a research company
        aiming to extend human life by 10 years, and "Helion Energy", an
        American fusion research company.[38][39]

        OpenAI was initially funded by Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Jessica
        Livingston, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Infosys, and YC
        Research. When OpenAI launched in 2015, it had raised $1 billion.[40] In
        March 2019, Sam Altman left Y Combinator to focus full-time on OpenAI as
        CEO.[41][1] By the summer of 2019, he had helped raise $1 billion from
        Microsoft.[42] Altman testified before the United States Senate
        Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law on 16 May 2023
        about issues of AI oversight.[43] After the success of ChatGPT, Altman
        made a world tour in May 2023, where he visited 22 countries and met
        multiple leaders and diplomats, including British prime minister Rishi
        Sunak, French president Emmanuel Macron, Spanish prime minister Pedro
        Sánchez, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Indian prime minister Narendra
        Modi, South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol, and Israeli president Isaac
        Herzog. He stood for a photo with European Commission president Ursula
        von der Leyen.[9] Removal and reinstatement as CEO Main article: Removal
        of Sam Altman from OpenAI On Friday November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board,
        composed of researcher Helen Toner, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, AI
        governance advocate Tasha McCauley, and most prominently in the firing,
        OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskyver, announced that
        they had made the decision to remove Altman as CEO and Greg Brockman
        from the board, both of whom were co-founders.[29] The announcement
        cited that Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications" in
        a public announcement on the OpenAI blog.[44][29] In response, Brockman
        resigned from his role as President of OpenAI.[45] The day after Altman
        was removed, The Verge reported that Altman and the board were in talks
        to bring him back to OpenAI.[46] On November 20, Microsoft CEO Satya
        Nadella announced that Altman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new
        advanced AI research team.[47] Two days later, OpenAI employees
        published an open letter to the board threatening to leave OpenAI and
        join Microsoft, where all employees had been promised jobs, unless all
        board members step down and reinstate Altman as CEO. 505 employees
        initially signed, which later grew to over 700 out of 770 total
        employees.[48] This included Ilya Sutskyver, who had previously
        advocated for firing Altman, but now had apologized stating on Twitter,
        "I regret my participation in the board's actions." Late in the night on
        November 20, OpenAI announced that they had reached an "agreement in
        principle" for Altman to return as CEO and Brockman to return as
        president.[49][50] The current board was to resign, other than D'Angelo,
        who was kept to represent the views of the previous board.

        In 2017, Altman received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from
        the University of Waterloo in Canada for supporting companies through
        its Velocity entrepreneurship program.[58] The government of Indonesia
        issued the country's first "golden visa", a 10-year border pass, to
        Altman in September 2023.[59] In 2023, Altman was named one of the 100
        most influential people in the world and CEO of the Year by Time
        magazine,[60][61] one of the "Best Young Entrepreneurs in Technology" by
        Businessweek in 2008,[62] and the top investor under 30 by Forbes
        magazine in 2015.[63] Altman was invited to attend the Bilderberg
        Meeting in 2016,[64] 2022,[65] and 2023.[66][67] Walter Isaacson opined
        that Altman had "Musk-like intensity" which was instrumental in the
        founding of OpenAI in partnership with Elon Musk.[68]

        YC.[5] It was later reported that Altman was fired from YC, and had
        appointed himself Chairman without authorization.[30] Altman co-founded
        Tools For Humanity in 2019,[31] a company which builds and distributes
        systems designed to scan people's eyes to provide authentication and
        verify proof of personhood to counter fraud. People who agree to have
        their eyes scanned are compensated with a cryptocurrency called
        Worldcoin.[32][33][34][35] Tools For Humanity describes its
        cryptocurrency as similar to universal basic income.[36][37] Altman has
        several other investments. Including, "Humane", the world's first
        wearable computer powered by AI, "Retro Biosciences", a research company
        aiming to extend human life by 10 years, and "Helion Energy", an
        American fusion research company.[38][39]

        OpenAI was initially funded by Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Jessica
        Livingston, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Infosys, and YC
        Research. When OpenAI launched in 2015, it had raised $1 billion.[40] In
        March 2019, Sam Altman left Y Combinator to focus full-time on OpenAI as
        CEO.[41][1] By the summer of 2019, he had helped raise $1 billion from
        Microsoft.[42] Altman testified before the United States Senate
        Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law on 16 May 2023
        about issues of AI oversight.[43] After the success of ChatGPT, Altman
        made a world tour in May 2023, where he visited 22 countries and met
        multiple leaders and diplomats, including British prime minister Rishi
        Sunak, French president Emmanuel Macron, Spanish prime minister Pedro
        Sánchez, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Indian prime minister Narendra
        Modi, South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol, and Israeli president Isaac
        Herzog. He stood for a photo with European Commission president Ursula
        von der Leyen.[9] Removal and reinstatement as CEO Main article: Removal
        of Sam Altman from OpenAI On Friday November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board,
        composed of researcher Helen Toner, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, AI
        governance advocate Tasha McCauley, and most prominently in the firing,
        OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskyver, announced that
        they had made the decision to remove Altman as CEO and Greg Brockman
        from the board, both of whom were co-founders.[29] The announcement
        cited that Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications" in
        a public announcement on the OpenAI blog.[44][29] In response, Brockman
        resigned from his role as President of OpenAI.[45] The day after Altman
        was removed, The Verge reported that Altman and the board were in talks
        to bring him back to OpenAI.[46] On November 20, Microsoft CEO Satya
        Nadella announced that Altman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new
        advanced AI research team.[47] Two days later, OpenAI employees
        published an open letter to the board threatening to leave OpenAI and
        join Microsoft, where all employees had been promised jobs, unless all
        board members step down and reinstate Altman as CEO. 505 employees
        initially signed, which later grew to over 700 out of 770 total
        employees.[48] This included Ilya Sutskyver, who had previously
        advocated for firing Altman, but now had apologized stating on Twitter,
        "I regret my participation in the board's actions." Late in the night on
        November 20, OpenAI announced that they had reached an "agreement in
        principle" for Altman to return as CEO and Brockman to return as
        president.[49][50] The current board was to resign, other than D'Angelo,
        who was kept to represent the views of the previous board.

        In 2017, Altman received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from
        the University of Waterloo in Canada for supporting companies through
        its Velocity entrepreneurship program.[58] The government of Indonesia
        issued the country's first "golden visa", a 10-year border pass, to
        Altman in September 2023.[59] In 2023, Altman was named one of the 100
        most influential people in the world and CEO of the Year by Time
        magazine,[60][61] one of the "Best Young Entrepreneurs in Technology" by
        Businessweek in 2008,[62] and the top investor under 30 by Forbes
        magazine in 2015.[63] Altman was invited to attend the Bilderberg
        Meeting in 2016,[64] 2022,[65] and 2023.[66][67] Walter Isaacson opined
        that Altman had "Musk-like intensity" which was instrumental in the
        founding of OpenAI in partnership with Elon Musk.[68]

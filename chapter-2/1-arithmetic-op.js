var x = 200; // x is a variable and 200 is a value

console.log(x + y); // + is a arithmetic operator 
// that adds the value of x and y

console.log(y - x); // - is a arithmetic operator
// that subtracts the value of x from y

console.log(x * y); // * is a arithmetic operator
// It is represented using an asterisk
// and it multiplies the value of x and y

console.log(x / y); // / is a arithmetic operator
// It gives out the quotient of x and y

console.log(x % y); // % is a arithmetic operator
// It is called the modulus operator
// It gives out the remainder of x and y
console.log(3%2); // 1

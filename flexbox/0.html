        Flexbox is like a set of rules for arranging things in a row or a column. 
        It helps you make layouts that can adjust and look good on different screen sizes. With Flexbox, 
        you can easily control how things are spaced out, aligned, and resized within a container on a webpage.
        
        Flexbox alone can make HTML responsive by allowing elements to dynamically adjust their size, position, 
        and alignment within a container based on available space. Here's how it works simply:
    
        - Flexbox provides properties that control how elements grow, shrink, and align.
        - Elements can stack vertically or horizontally depending on the flex direction.
        - Flexbox allows for easy centering of elements both horizontally and vertically.
        - By using Flexbox properties, developers can create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes 
        without needing media queries or fixed widths.
        
        This flexibility makes it easier to build responsive designs that look good on various devices.

        The display: flex; property on the container creates a flex container, allowing the boxes to be flex items.
        
        - The justify-content: space-around; property evenly spaces the boxes with space around them, 
        adjusting automatically based on the container's width.

        - As the screen size changes, the flex layout dynamically adjusts the spacing between the 
        boxes while maintaining their alignment, making the layout responsive to different screen sizes.
